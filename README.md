# ðŸ¤‘ Coin Ticker

A Flutter application that fetches and displays live cryptocurrency prices for **Bitcoin (BTC)**, **Ethereum (ETH)**, and **Litecoin (LTC)**. Users can choose from a variety of fiat currencies, and the app dynamically updates the exchange rates using [CoinAPI](https://www.coinapi.io/).

## Features
### 1. Live Cryptocurrency Prices
- Fetches the latest exchange rates for BTC, ETH, and LTC.
- Displays real-time data for user-selected fiat currencies such as USD, EUR, AUD, etc.

### 2. Currency Selection
- Platform-specific UI:
  - **Android**: Uses a `DropdownButton` for selecting currencies.
  - **iOS**: Uses a `CupertinoPicker` for smooth scrolling through currency options.

### 3. Dynamic UI Updates
- Automatically updates cryptocurrency rates when the user changes the selected currency.
- Clean and responsive design with a visually appealing card layout.
